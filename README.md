## Technology Stack

> #### Frontend
> - Next.js
> - SASS
> - React Markdown
> #### Backend
> - Node.js
> - Express
> - PostgreSQL
> - Drizzle ORM
> - JWT

### Next.js
- has strong community support and ecosystem
- vercel hosting is fast and pain-free, good for prototyping
- file based routing is so good, it is quickly becoming a standard, seeing other open-source projects like react-native following suit.

### SASS and CSS Variables
- Frontend caching

### Node.js
- Mature Ecosystem
- Extensive libraries
- Stable

### PostgreSQL powered by Drizzle

- PostgreSQL is highly reliable, and rich in features like full-text search, that is highly relevant for this project
- Drizzle has great migration tools, with Drizzle Kit, making it great for agile development and prototyping.


## API Design Philosophy

### Structure

### External APIs

### Handling rate limits and failures

### Authentication

- As this project is designed to be a lean prototype, I have decided to have authentication in-built to showcase my understanding of authentication concepts such as JWT.


## Performance & Scalability

### Handling increased load

### What are the current bottlenecks?

### Optimizations


## Integration Strategy Document

### External APIs

### Error handling of External APIs

### Security considerations for API keys and user data

- Environment files



## Caching Strategies

### Frontend Server Caching

### External API Caching


## Critical Analysis

### What works well

### Limitations

- Responsive layout limited to three sizes
- at the moment route naming is based on database's primary keys. This is mainly a lean approach during the prototyping phase where course materials are not finalized. When materials are finalized, it is advisable to use more descriptive text as route names i.e. "https://edufullstack.io/dsa/algorithms".
